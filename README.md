# which-steam-game
Command line tool to determine which multiplayer/coop steam game you and your friends should play.

Install using `cargo install which-steam-game`

I've tested successfully on Windows and Mac

It requires the [steamworks sdk](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip) version 1.54 to be installed where Windows or MacOS will find it

There's also a precompiled windows binary in releases.
