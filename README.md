# which-steam-game
Command line tool to determine which multiplayer/coop steam game you and your friends should play.

Install using `cargo install which-steam-game`

I've tested on Windows and Mac and of the two it only works on Windows.

It requires the [steamworks sdk](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip) to be installed where Windows will find the dll.
